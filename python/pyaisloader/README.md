# PyAISLoader

PyAISLoader is a CLI for running benchmarks that leverage the AIStore Python SDK.

## Getting Started

From `aistore/python/pyaisloader`, run the following to install all required dependencies:

```shell
make install
```

## Usage

The general usage is:

```shell
pyaisloader [TYPE] --bucket [BUCKET] --workers [WORKERS] --cleanup ...
```

> Options are specific to the type of benchmark being performed. For more information on the benchmark-specific options, run `pyaisloader PUT --help`, `pyaisloader GET --help`, `pyaisloader MIXED --help`, or `pyaisloader LIST --help`, or refer to the documentation below.

> For all benchmark types, `--cleanup`, or `-c`, if set to `True`, clean-up will either **(i)** destroy the entire bucket if the benchmark created the bucket or **(ii)** destroy any objects that were added to the pre-existing bucket during the benchmark (and pre-population). 

#### Type: PUT

Runs time/size based benchmark with 100% PUT workload.

> **Note:** At least one of `duration` or `totalsize` must be specified. If both parameters are provided, the benchmark will terminate once either condition is fulfilled."

#### Type: GET

Runs a time-based benchmark with 100% GET workload.

> **Note:** `totalsize` represents the desired total size of the bucket prior to initiating the benchmark. If the current size of the bucket is less than `totalsize`, the benchmark will pre-populate the bucket to reach totalsize. This pre-populating process involves the addition of objects whose sizes range between `minsize` and `maxsize`. It's important to note that all three parameters must be provided together. If one or two of these parameters are missing, none should be provided. These parameters are interdependent and the benchmark requires the specification of all or none of them. If `totalsize`, `minsize`, and `maxsize` are not provided, the benchmark will run on the existing contents of the bucket as is, without any prior adjustment or pre-population.

> **Note:** If the benchmark creates a bucket, or if the provided bucket is empty, it will start by creating a single object within the bucket. If you'd like a more specific load, please use `totalsize`, `minsize`, and `maxsize`, or use a bucket that is not empty.

#### Type: MIXED

Runs a time-based benchmark with a mixed load of GETs and PUTs (based on `putpct`).

> **Note:** If the benchmark creates a bucket, or if the provided bucket is empty, it will start by creating a single object within the bucket. If you want your MIXED benchmark to include a more intensive GET load, you should consider using a pre-filled bucket.

#### Type: LIST

Runs a benchmark to LIST objects in the bucket.

> **Note:** If you provide an `objects` value, the benchmark will pre-populate the bucket until it contains the specified number of objects. If the `objects` value is not given, the benchmark will simply run on the current state of the bucket, without adding any additional items.

### Examples

There are a few sample benchmarks in the provided Makefile. Run `make help` for more information on the sample benchmarks.

This section provides a rundown of the sample benchmarks defined in the Makefile. You can use `make <target>` to run these benchmarks, where `<target>` is replaced by the desired benchmark. Use `make help` to display the list of available targets.

1. `make install`
This command installs the required Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and installs the current project as a package.

2. `short_put`
This command runs a short `PUT` benchmark on the bucket `ais://abc`. The benchmark will stop either when the specified `duration` has elapsed or when the total size of data `PUT` into the bucket reaches `totalsize`.

3. `short_get`
This command runs a short `GET` benchmark on the bucket `ais://abc`. If the total size of contents of `ais://abc` are smaller than the specified `totalsize`, the bucket will be pre-populated up to `totalsize`, with the size of individual objects ranging from `minsize` to `maxsize`. The benchmark will terminate when `duration` amount of time has passed.

4. `short_mixed`
This command runs a short `MIXED` benchmark on the ais://abc bucket. The parameter `putpct` determines the ratio of `PUT` operations to `GET` operations (e.g. a `putpct` of `50` approximately implies that 50% of the operations will be `PUT` operations, and the remaining 50% will be `GET` operations). The benchmark will terminate when `duration` amount of time has passed.

5. `short_list`
This command runs a short `LIST` benchmark on the bucket `ais://abc`. If there are less than `objects` amount of objects in the bucket, the bucket will be pre-populated to contain `objects` number of objects.

6. `long_put`
This command runs a long `PUT` benchmark on the bucket `ais://abc`. The benchmark will stop when the specified `duration` of 30 minutes has elapsed or when the total size of data `PUT` into the bucket reaches `totalsize` of 10GB. The size of individual objects ranges from `minsize` of 50MB to `maxsize` of 100MB, and the number of `worker` threads used is increased to 32 compared to the short `PUT` benchmark.

7. `long_get`
This command runs a long `GET` benchmark on the bucket `ais://abc`. The primary differences are that this benchmark runs for a longer `duration` (30 minutes as opposed to 30 seconds) and uses more `worker` threads (32 instead of 16).

8. `long_mixed`
This command runs a long `MIXED` benchmark on the bucket `ais://abc`. The `putpct` parameter still determines the ratio of `PUT` operations to `GET` operations. The differences here are the longer `duration` of 30 minutes and and the increased number of `worker` threads (32 instead of 16).

9. `long_list`
This command runs a long `LIST` benchmark on the bucket `ais://abc`. If there are fewer than `objects` amount of objects in the bucket, the bucket will be pre-populated to contain `objects` number of objects. The `long_list` benchmark differs from `short_list` in the number of `objects` (500,000 instead of 50,000) and the number of `worker` threads used (32 instead of 16).

10. `help`
This command displays a list of available targets in the Makefile along with their descriptions, providing a helpful guide for understanding and using the available commands.
