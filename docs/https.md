## Generating self-signed certificates

Creating a self-signed certificate along with its private key and a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) involves steps:

* First, we create a self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) certificate (`ca.crt`).
* Second, create a Certificate Signing Request (`server.csr`).
* Finally, based on the CSR and CA we create the server certs (`server.key` and `server.crt`) - as follows:

```console
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -days 1024 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost" -extensions v3_ca -config <(printf "[req]\ndistinguished_name=req\nx509_extensions=v3_ca\n[ v3_ca ]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost,DNS:127.0.0.1,IP:127.0.0.1\nbasicConstraints=CA:TRUE\n")

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Santa Clara/O=NVIDIA/OU=AIStore/CN=localhost" -config <(printf "[req]\ndistinguished_name=req\nreq_extensions = v3_req\n[ v3_req ]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost,DNS:127.0.0.1,IP:127.0.0.1\n")

openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365 -sha256 -extfile <(printf "[ext]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost,DNS:127.0.0.1,IP:127.0.0.1\nbasicConstraints=CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature,nonRepudiation,keyEncipherment,dataEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth,clientAuth\n") -extensions ext
```

> **Important:** make sure to specify correct DNS. For local deployments, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` domain must be provided - otherwise certificate validation will fail.

## Deploying: 4 targets, 1 gateway, 6 mountpaths, AWS backend

This is still a so-called _local playground_ type deployment _from scratch_, whereby we are not trying to switch an existing cluster from HTTP to HTTPS, or vice versa. All we do here is deploying a brand new HTTPS-based aistore.

> Note: If you need to switch an existing AIS cluster to HTTPS, please refer to [these steps](switch_https.md).

```console
## shutdown previous running AIS cluster
$ make kill

## cleanup
$ make clean

## run cluster: 4 targets, 1 gateway, 6 mountpaths, AWS backend, HTTPS
$ TAGS=aws AIS_USE_HTTPS=true AIS_SKIP_VERIFY_CRT=true AIS_SERVER_CRT=<path-to-cert>/server.crt AIS_SERVER_KEY=<path-to-key>/server.key make deploy <<< $'4\n1\n6'
```
> Notice environment variables above: **AIS_USE_HTTPS**, **AIS_SKIP_VERIFY_CRT**, **AIS_SERVER_CRT** and **AIS_SERVER_KEY**.

> Also note that `<path-to-cert>` (above) must not necessarily be absolute. Assuming, you have `server.*` certs in your **local directory**, the following will work as well:

```console
$ TAGS=aws AIS_USE_HTTPS=true AIS_SKIP_VERIFY_CRT=true AIS_SERVER_CRT=server.crt AIS_SERVER_KEY=server.key make deploy <<< $'4\n1\n6'
```

## Accessing HTTPS-based cluster

To use CLI, try first any command with HTTPS-based cluster endpoint, for instance:

```console
$ AIS_ENDPOINT=https://127.0.0.1:8080 ais show cluster
```

But if it fails with "failed to verify certificate" message, perform a simple step to configufre CLI to skip HTTPS cert validation:

```console
$ ais config cli set cluster.skip_verify_crt true
"cluster.skip_verify_crt" set to: "true" (was: "false")
```

And then try again.

## Testing with self-signed certificates

In the previous example, the cluster is simply ignoring SSL certificate verification due to `AIS_SKIP_VERIFY_CRT` being `true`. For a more secure setup, consider validating certificates by configuring the necessary environment variables as shown in the table below:

| var name | description | the corresponding cluster configuration |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `AIS_USE_HTTPS`          | when false, we use plain HTTP with all the TLS config (below) simply **ignored** | "net.http.use_https" |
| `AIS_SERVER_CRT`         | aistore cluster X.509 certificate | "net.http.server_crt" |
| `AIS_SERVER_KEY`         | certificate's private key | "net.http.server_key"|
| `AIS_DOMAIN_TLS`         | NOTE: not supported, must be empty (domain, hostname, or SAN registered with the certificate) | "net.http.domain_tls"|
| `AIS_CLIENT_CA_TLS`      | Certificate authority that authorized (signed) the certificate | "net.http.client_ca_tls" |
| `AIS_CLIENT_AUTH_TLS`    | Client authentication during TLS handshake: a range from 0 (no authentication) to 4 (request and validate client's certificate) | "net.http.client_auth_tls" |
| `AIS_SKIP_VERIFY_CRT`    | when true: skip X.509 cert verification (usually enabled to circumvent limitations of self-signed certs) | "net.http.skip_verify" |

> More info on [`AIS_CLIENT_AUTH_TLS`](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#ClientAuthType).

In the following example, we run https based deployment where `AIS_SKIP_VERIFY_CRT` is `false`.

```console
$ make kill
$ # delete smaps
$ find ~/.ais* -type f -name ".ais.smap" | xargs rm
$ # substitute varibles in below files to point to correct certificates
$ source ais/test/tls-env/server.conf
$ source ais/test/tls-env/client.conf
$ AIS_USE_HTTPS=true make deploy <<< $'6\n6\n4\ny\ny\nn\n\n'
```

Notice that when the cluster is first time deployed `server.conf` environment (above) overrides aistore cluster configuration.

> Environment is ignored upon cluster restarts and upgrades.

On the other hand, `ais/test/tls-env/client.conf` contains environment variables to override CLI config. The correspondence between environment and config names is easy to see as well.

> See also: [Client-side TLS environment](/docs/cli.md#environment-variables)

## Observability: TLS related alerts

HTTPS deployment implies (and requires) that each AIS node has a valid TLS (a.k.a. [X.509](https://www.ssl.com/faqs/what-is-an-x-509-certificate/)) certificate.

The latter has a number of interesting properties ultimately intended to authenticate clients to the server (AIS node, in this case), and vice versa.

In addition, TLS certfificates tend to expire from time to time. In fact, each TLS certificate has expiration date with the standard-defined maximum being 13 months (397 days).

> Some sources claim 398 days but the (much) larger point remains: TLS certificates do expire. Which means, they must be periodically updated and timely reloaded.

Starting v3.24, AIStore:

* tracks certificate expiration times;
* automatically - upon update - reloads updated certificates;
* raises associated alerts.

### Associated alerts

```console
$ ais show cluster

PROXY            MEM AVAIL  LOAD AVERAGE    UPTIME      STATUS  ALERT
p[KKFpNjqo][P]   127.77GiB  [5.2 7.2 3.1]   108h30m40s  online  **tls-cert-will-soon-expire**
...

TARGET           MEM AVAIL  CAP USED(%)     CAP AVAIL   LOAD AVERAGE    UPTIME      STATUS  ALERT
t[pDztYhhb]      98.02GiB   16%             960.824GiB  [9.1 13.4 8.3]  108h30m1s  online   **tls-cert-will-soon-expire**
...
...
```

Overall, there are currently 3 (three) alerts:

| alert | comment |
| -- | -- |
| `tls-cert-will-soon-expire` | a warning that X.509 cert will expire in less than 3 days |
| `tls-cert-expired` | red alert (as the name implies) |
| `tls-cert-invalid` | ditto |

## Updating and reloading X.509 certificates

Quoting WWW:

> "The validity periods for digital certificates are determined by their accepting organizations ...", at [https://www.sectigo.com/resource-library/how-long-are-digital-certificates-valid](https://www.sectigo.com/resource-library/how-long-are-digital-certificates-valid)

Long story short, there is any number of reasons to update or replace X.509 certificate that AIStore uses to authenticate API calls.

But maybe the most common one is - expiration time. TLS certificates, also often referred to as [X.509](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509) certificates, do periodically expire. And the immediate implication is that the system must be able to (periodically) reload updated ones.

In AIStore, related functionality consists of two pieces:

1. AIS nodes automatically reload updated certs while simultaneously adjusting the interval to check for the update.
2. Separately, there's an administrative [API](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/main/api/cluster.go) and CLI (shown below) to reload certificate.

The scope of this latter operation may be either a selected node or entire cluster.

As far as automatic adjustment of the polling interval, the resulting value depends on the remaining time (until expired) and works [approximately](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/main/cmn/certloader/certloader.go) as follows:

| time to expire | period to check for renewal |
| -- | -- |
| more than 24h | 6 hours |
| more than 6h | 1 hour |
| more than 1h | 10m |
| more than 1s | 1m |
| `expired` | 1h |

Upon initial loading, or every time when reloading, an AIS node logs a record that also shows the validity bounds, e.g.:

```log
I 11:05:45.753438 certloader:151 server.crt[26 Aug 24 18:18 UTC, 26 Aug 25 18:18 UTC]
```

In addition, if certificate fails to load or expires, AIS node raises the namesake alert that - as usual - will show up in Grafana dashboard or via CLI `show cluster`, or both.

```console
$ ais show cluster

PROXY            MEM USED(%)    MEM AVAIL   LOAD AVERAGE    UPTIME  STATUS  ALERT
p[atipJhgn][P]   0.17%          27.51GiB    [0.3 0.1 0.0]   -       online  **tls-cert-expired**

TARGET           MEM USED(%)    MEM AVAIL   CAP USED(%)     CAP AVAIL       LOAD AVERAGE    STATUS  ALERT
t[NlLtPtrm]      0.16%          27.51GiB    16%             367.538GiB      [0.3 0.1 0.0]   online  **tls-cert-expired**
```

Overall, supported alerts include:

| alert | comment |
| -- | -- |
| `tls-cert-will-soon-expire` | warning: less than 3 days remains until X.509 cert expires |
| `tls-cert-expired` | X.509 expired (red alert, as the name implies) |
| `tls-cert-invalid` | e.g., invalid PEM format; further details at [OpenSSL: X.509 errors](https://x509errors.org/)  |

Finally, to view (existing) and/or reload (new) TLS certificates, see the following CLI reference:

* [Managing TLS Certificates](/docs/cli/x509.md)

When aistore is deployed with aithentication (enabled), the API (and CLI) to reload certificates will require administrative permissions.

> See `ais config cluster` command and related `auth.enabled` knob.

## Switching cluster between HTTP and HTTPS

### From HTTP to HTTPS

This assumes that [X.509 certificate already exists](getting_started.md#setting-up-https-locally) and the (HTTP-based) cluster is up and running. All we need to do at this point is switch it to HTTPS.

```console
# step 1: reconfigure cluster to use HTTPS
$ ais config cluster net.http.use_https true

# step 2: add information related to certs
$ ais config cluster net.http.skip_verify true
$ ais config cluster net.http.server_key <path-to-cert>/cert.key
$ ais config cluster net.http.server_crt <path-to-cert>/cert.crt

# step 3: shutdown
$ ais cluster shutdown

# step 4: remove cluster map - all copies at all possible locations, for example:
$ find ~/.ais* -type f -name ".ais.smap" | xargs rm

# step 5: restart
$ make kill cli deploy <<< $'6\n6\n4\ny\ny\nn\n'

# step 6: optionally, run aisloader
$ AIS_ENDPOINT=https://localhost:8080 aisloader -bucket=ais://nnn -cleanup=false -numworkers=8 -pctput=0 -randomproxy

# step 7: optionally, reconfigure CLI to skip X.509 verification:
$ ais config cli set cluster.skip_verify_crt true

# step 8: run CLI
$ AIS_ENDPOINT=https://127.0.0.1:8080 ais show cluster

$ AIS_ENDPOINT=https://127.0.0.1:8080 ais archive gen-shards "ais://abc/shard-{001..999}.tar.lz4"
Shards created: 999/999 [==============================================================] 100 %

$ export AIS_ENDPOINT=https://localhost:8080

$ ais ls ais://abc --summary
NAME           PRESENT         OBJECTS         SIZE (apparent, objects, remote)        USAGE(%)
ais://abc      yes             999 0           5.86MiB 5.20MiB 0B                      0%
...
...
```

Goes without saying that `localhost` etc. are used here (and elsewhere) for purely illustrative purposes.

Instead of `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, port `8080`, and the `make` command above one must use their respective correct endpoints and proper deployment operations.

### From HTTPS back to HTTP

```console
# step 1: disable HTTPS
$ AIS_ENDPOINT=https://127.0.0.1:8080 ais config cluster net.http.use_https false

# step 2: shutdown (notice that we are still using HTTPS endpoint)
$ AIS_ENDPOINT=https://127.0.0.1:8080 ais cluster shutdown -y

# step 3: remove cluster maps
$ find ~/.ais* -type f -name ".ais.smap" | xargs rm

# step 4: restart
$ make kill cli deploy <<< $'6\n6\n4\ny\ny\nn\n'

# step 5: and use
$ ais show cluster
