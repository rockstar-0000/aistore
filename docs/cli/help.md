This readme is a loose assortment of quick tips.

## Installing CLI directly from the latest GitHub release

The default destination is /usr/local/bin but here we install into /tmp/www

```console
$ deploy/scripts/install_from_binaries.sh --dstdir /tmp/www

Done.

$ ls /tmp/www

# Getting help

Note that `ais help <command>` is identical to `ais <command> --help`. In fact, the `--help` option is absolutely universal and will work across the entire CLI terms of providing context-relevant information. 

But first, let's see all CLI top-level commands with brief descriptions.

> The text below can serve as a 30-seconds brief introduction into CLI usage and its capabilities.
