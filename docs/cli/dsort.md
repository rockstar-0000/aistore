## Usage

`ais dsort [command options] [JSON_SPECIFICATION|YAML_SPECIFICATION|-] [SRC_BUCKET] [DST_BUCKET]`

```console
$ ais dsort --help
NAME:
   ais dsort - (alias for "job start dsort") start dsort job
   Required parameters:
              - input_bck: source bucket (used as both source and destination if the latter not specified)
              - input_format: (see docs and examples below)
              - output_format: (ditto)
              - output_shard_size: (as the name implies)
   E.g. inline JSON spec:
                $ ais start dsort '{
                  "extension": ".tar",
                  "input_bck": {"name": "dsort-testing"},
                  "input_format": {"template": "shard-{0..9}"},
                  "output_shard_size": "200KB",
                  "description": "pack records into categorized shards",
                  "order_file": "http://website.web/static/order_file.txt",
                  "order_file_sep": " "
                }'
   E.g. inline YAML spec:
                $ ais start dsort -f - <<EOM
                  extension: .tar
                  input_bck:
                      name: dsort-testing
                  input_format:
                      template: shard-{0..9}
                  output_format: new-shard-{0000..1000}
                  output_shard_size: 10KB
                  description: shuffle shards from 0 to 9
                  algorithm:
                      kind: shuffle
                  EOM
   Tip: use '--dry-run' to see the results without making any changes
   Tip: use '--verbose' to print the spec (with all its parameters including applied defaults)
   See also: docs/dsort.md, docs/cli/dsort.md, and ais/test/scripts/dsort*

USAGE:
   ais dsort [command options] [JSON_SPECIFICATION|YAML_SPECIFICATION|-] [SRC_BUCKET] [DST_BUCKET]

OPTIONS:
   --file value, -f value  path to JSON or YAML job specification
   --verbose, -v           verbose

```

## Example

This example simply runs [ais/test/scripts/dsort-ex1-spec.json](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/ais/test/scripts/dsort-ex1-spec.json) specification. The source and destination buckets - ais://src and ais://dst, respectively - must exist.

Further, the source buckets must have at least 10 shards with names that match `input_format` (see below).

Notice the `-v` (`--verbose`) switch as well.

```console
$ ais start dsort ais://src ais://dst -f ais/test/scripts/dsort-ex1-spec.json --verbose

## Generate Shards

`ais archive gen-shards "BUCKET/TEMPLATE.EXT"`

Put randomly generated shards into a bucket. The main use case for this command is dSort testing.
[Further reference for this command can be found here.](archive.md#generate-shards)

## Start dSort job

`ais start dsort JOB_SPEC` or `ais start dsort -f <PATH_TO_JOB_SPEC>`

Start new dSort job with the provided specification.
Specification should be provided by either argument or `-f` flag - providing both argument and flag will result in error.
Upon creation, `JOB_ID` of the job is returned - it can then be used to abort it or retrieve metrics.

| Flag | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--file, -f` | `string` | Path to file containing JSON or YAML job specification. Providing `-` will result in reading from STDIN | `""` |

The following table describes JSON/YAML keys which can be used in the specification.

| Key | Type | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `extension` | `string` | extension of input and output shards (either `.tar`, `.tgz` or `.zip`) | yes | |

| `output_shard_size` | `string` | size (in bytes) of the output shard, can be in form of raw numbers `10240` or suffixed `10KB` | yes | |
| `algorithm.kind` | `string` | determines which sorting algorithm dSort job uses, available are: `"alphanumeric"`, `"shuffle"`, `"content"` | no | `"alphanumeric"` |
| `algorithm.decreasing` | `bool` | determines if the algorithm should sort the records in decreasing or increasing order, used for `kind=alphanumeric` or `kind=content` | no | `false` |
| `algorithm.seed` | `string` | seed provided to random generator, used when `kind=shuffle` | no | `""` - `time.Now()` is used |
| `algorithm.extension` | `string` | content of the file with provided extension will be used as sorting key, used when `kind=content` | yes (only when `kind=content`) |
| `algorithm.content_key_type` | `string` | content key type; may have one of the following values: "int", "float", or "string"; used exclusively with `kind=content` sorting | yes (only when `kind=content`) |
| `order_file` | `string` | URL to the file containing external key map (it should contain lines in format: `record_key[sep]shard-%d-fmt`) | yes (only when `output_format` not provided) | `""` |

| `max_mem_usage` | `string` | limits the amount of total system memory allocated by both dSort and other running processes. Once and if this threshold is crossed, dSort will continue extracting onto local drives. Can be in format 60% or 10GB | no | same as in `/deploy/dev/local/aisnode_config.sh` |
| `extract_concurrency_max_limit` | `int` | limits maximum number of concurrent shards extracted per disk | no | (calculated based on different factors) ~50 |
| `create_concurrency_max_limit` | `int` | limits maximum number of concurrent shards created per disk| no | (calculated based on different factors) ~50 |
| `extended_metrics` | `bool` | determines if dSort should collect extended statistics | no | `false` |

There's also the possibility to override some of the values from global `distributed_sort` config via job specification.
All values are optional - if empty, the value from global `distributed_sort` config will be used.
For more information refer to [configuration](/docs/configuration.md).

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `duplicated_records` | `string` | what to do when duplicated records are found: "ignore" - ignore and continue, "warn" - notify a user and continue, "abort" - abort dSort operation |
| `missing_shards` | `string` | what to do when missing shards are detected: "ignore" - ignore and continue, "warn" - notify a user and continue, "abort" - abort dSort operation |
| `ekm_malformed_line` | `string`| what to do when extraction key map notices a malformed line: "ignore" - ignore and continue, "warn" - notify a user and continue, "abort" - abort dSort operation |
| `ekm_missing_key` | `string` | what to do when extraction key map have a missing key: "ignore" - ignore and continue, "warn" - notify a user and continue, "abort" - abort dSort operation |
| `dsorter_mem_threshold` | `string`| minimum free memory threshold which will activate specialized dsorter type which uses memory in creation phase - benchmarks shows that this type of dsorter behaves better than general type |

### Examples

#### Sort records inside the shards

Command defined below starts (alphanumeric) sorting job with extended metrics for **input** shards with names `shard-0.tar`, `shard-1.tar`, ..., `shard-9.tar`.
Each of the **output** shards will have at least `10240` bytes (`10KB`) and will be named `new-shard-0000.tar`, `new-shard-0001.tar`, ...

Assuming that `dsort_spec.json` contains:

```json
{
    "extension": ".tar",
    "input_bck": {"name": "dsort-testing"},
    "input_format": {
	template: "shard-{0..9}"
    },
    "output_format": "new-shard-{0000..1000}",
    "output_shard_size": "10KB",
    "description": "sort shards from 0 to 9",
    "algorithm": {
        "kind": "alphanumeric"
    },
    "extended_metrics": true
}
```

You can start dSort job with:

```console
$ ais start dsort -f dsort_spec.json
JGHEoo89gg
```

#### Shuffle records

Command defined below starts basic shuffle job for **input** shards with names `shard-0.tar`, `shard-1.tar`, ..., `shard-9.tar`.
Each of the **output** shards will have at least `10240` bytes (`10KB`) and will be named `new-shard-0000.tar`, `new-shard-0001.tar`, ...

```console
$ ais start dsort -f - <<EOM
extension: .tar
input_bck:
    name: dsort-testing
input_format:
    template: shard-{0..9}
output_format: new-shard-{0000..1000}
output_shard_size: 10KB
description: shuffle shards from 0 to 9
algorithm:
    kind: shuffle
EOM
JGHEoo89gg
```

#### Pack records into shards with different categories - EKM (External Key Map)

One of the key features of the dSort is that user can specify the exact mapping from the record key to the output shard.
To use this feature `output_format` should be empty and `order_file`, as well as `order_file_sep`, must be set.
The output shards will be created with provided format which must contain mandatory `%d` which is required to enumerate the shards.

Assuming that `order_file` (URL: `http://website.web/static/order_file.txt`) has content:

```
cat_0.txt shard-cats-%d
cat_1.txt shard-cats-%d
...
dog_0.txt shard-dogs-%d
dog_1.txt shard-dogs-%d
...
car_0.txt shard-car-%d
car_1.txt shard-car-%d
...
```

or if `order_file` (URL: `http://website.web/static/order_file.json`, notice `.json` extension) and has content:

```json
{
  "shard-cats-%d": [
    "cat_0.txt",
    "cat_1.txt",
    ...
  ],
  "shard-dogs-%d": [
    "dog_0.txt",
    "dog_1.txt",
    ...
  ],
  "shard-car-%d": [
    "car_0.txt",
    "car_1.txt",
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

and content of the **input** shards looks more or less like this:

```
shard-0.tar:
- cat_0.txt
- dog_0.txt
- car_0.txt
...
shard-1.tar:
- cat_1.txt
- dog_1.txt
- car_1.txt
...
```

You can run:

```console
$ ais start dsort '{
    "extension": ".tar",
    "input_bck": {"name": "dsort-testing"},
    "input_format": {"template": "shard-{0..9}"},
    "output_shard_size": "200KB",
    "description": "pack records into categorized shards",
    "order_file": "http://website.web/static/order_file.txt",
    "order_file_sep": " "
}'
JGHEoo89gg
```

After the run, the **output** shards will look more or less like this (the number of records in given shard depends on provided `output_shard_size`):

```
shard-cats-0.tar:
- cat_1.txt
- cat_2.txt
shard-cats-1.tar:
- cat_3.txt
- cat_4.txt
...
shard-dogs-0.tar:
- dog_1.txt
- dog_2.txt
...
```

## Show dSort jobs and job status

`ais show job dsort [JOB_ID]`

Retrieve the status of the dSort with provided `JOB_ID` which is returned upon creation.
Lists all dSort jobs if the `JOB_ID` argument is omitted.

### Options

| Flag | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--regex` | `string` | Regex for the description of dSort jobs | `""` |
| `--refresh` | `duration` | Refresh interval - time duration between reports. The usual unit suffixes are supported and include `m` (for minutes), `s` (seconds), `ms` (milliseconds). E.g.:  `--refresh 2s`| ` ` |
| `--verbose, -v` | `bool` | Show detailed metrics | `false` |
| `--log` | `string` | Path to file where the metrics will be saved (does not work with progress bar) | `/tmp/dsort_run.txt` |
| `--json, -j` | `bool` | Show only json metrics | `false` |
