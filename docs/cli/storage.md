`ais storage` commands supports the following subcommands:

```console
$ ais storage <TAB-TAB>
cleanup     disk        mountpath   summary     validate
```

Alternatively (or in addition), run with `--help` to view subcommands and short descriptions, both:

```console
$ ais storage --help
NAME:
   ais storage - monitor and manage clustered storage

USAGE:
   ais storage command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   show       show storage usage and utilization, disks and mountpaths
   summary    show bucket sizes and %% of used capacity on a per-bucket basis
   validate   check buckets for misplaced objects and objects that have insufficient numbers of copies or EC slices
   mountpath  show and attach/detach target mountpaths
   disk       show disk utilization and read/write statistics
   cleanup    perform storage cleanup: remove deleted objects and old/obsolete workfiles

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

As always, each subcommand (above) will have its own help and usage examples - the latter possibly spread across multiple markdowns.

> You can easily look up examples and descriptions of any keyword via a simple `find`, for instance:

```console
$ find . -type f -name "*.md" | xargs grep "ais.*mountpath"
```

## Storage cleanup

As all other supported batch operations (aka `xactions`), cleanup runs asynchronously and can be monitored during its run, e.g.:

```console
# ais storage cleanup
Started storage cleanup "BlpmlObF8", use 'ais job show xaction BlpmlObF8' to monitor the progress
```

## Show capacity usage

`ais storage summary [BUCKET | PROVIDER]`

Show summary information on a per bucket basis. If `BUCKET` is specified in the command line, the output gets narrowed down to this specific bucket. The same goes for `PROVIDER` (e.g., `ais://`, `aws://`, `gs://`, etc.) - again, only if specified.

> Bucket providers and supported remote backends are documented [here](/docs/providers.md).

Depending on the command line options (listed below), per-bucket information includes total number of objects, size of the bucket in bytes or megabytes, and percentage of the total capacity used by the bucket.

A recently added `--validate` option is intended to analyze integrity of the stored distributed content. The questions that we ask at validation time "cover" location of stored objects and their replicas, the number of replicas (and whether this number agrees with the bucket configuration), etc.

In particular, location of each objects stored in the cluster must at any point in time correspond to the current cluster map and, within each storage target, to the target's *mountpaths* (disks).  A failure to abide by location rules is called "misplacement"; misplaced objects - if any - must be migrated to their proper locations via automated processes called `global rebalance` and `resilver`:

* [global rebalance and reslver](/docs/rebalance.md)
* [resilvering selected targets: advanced usage](/docs/resourcesvanced.md)

When `--fast` option is used the summary will include (internal-usage) details such as temporary objects, copies, EC slices, metadata files, and more.

### Options

| Flag | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fast` | `bool` | The option is designed primarily for internal usage. The output may not accurately reflect user-accessible content. | `false` |
| `--validate` | `bool` | Check objects for errors: misplaced, insufficient number of copies etc | `false` |
| `--cached` | `bool` | For buckets that have remote backend, list only objects stored in the cluster | `false` |
| `--count` | `int` | Can be used in combination with `--refresh` option to limit the number of generated reports | `1` |
| `--refresh` | `duration` | Refresh interval - time duration between reports. The usual unit suffixes are supported and include `m` (for minutes), `s` (seconds), `ms` (milliseconds) | ` ` |


### Example

Show summary for all buckets.

```console
$ ais storage summary
NAME             OBJECTS         SIZE            USED %
ais://bck        2               59.24KiB        0.00%
```

Show estimated summary.

```console
$ ais storage summary --fast
NAME             EST. OBJECTS    EST. SIZE       EST. USED %
ais://bck        4               224.00KiB       0.00%
```

The bucket `ais://bck` has mirroring enabled, so its number of objects doubles.

## Validate buckets

`ais storage validate [BUCKET | PROVIDER]`

Checks all objects of the bucket `BUCKET` and show the number of found issues:
the number of misplaced objects, the number of objects that have insufficient number of copies etc.
Non-zero number of misplaced objects may mean a bucket needs rebalancing.

If the optional argument is omitted, show information about all buckets.

Because the command checks every object, it may take a lot of time for big buckets.
It is recommended to set bucket name or provider name to decrease execution time.

### Example

Validate only AIS buckets

```
$ ais storage validate  ais://
BUCKET            OBJECTS         MISPLACED       MISSING COPIES
ais://bck1        2               0               0
ais://bck2        3               1               0
```

The bucket `ais://bck2` has 3 objects and one of them is misplaced, i.e. it is inaccessible by a client.
It results in `ais ls ais://bck2` returns only 2 objects.

## Mountpath (and disk) management

There are two related commands:

* `ais storage disk`
* `ais storage mountpath`

where `mountpath` is a higher-level abstraction that typically "utilizes" a single undivided disk. More exactly:

> A *mountpath* is a single disk **or** a volume (a RAID) formatted with a local filesystem of choice, **and** a local directory that AIS utilizes to store user data and AIS metadata. A mountpath can be disabled and (re)enabled, automatically or administratively, at any point during runtime. In a given cluster, a total number of mountpaths would normally compute as a direct product of (number of storage targets) x (number of disks in each target).

You can manage and monitor (i.e., `show`) disks and mountpaths using `ais storage` command.

> For strictly monitoring purposes, you can universally use `ais show` command, e.g.: `ais show storage disk`, etc.

## Show disks

`ais storage disk show [TARGET_ID]`

or, same:

`ais show storage disk [TARGET_ID]`

## Show mountpaths

As the name implies, the syntax:

`ais show storage mountpath [TARGET_ID]`

for example:

```console
$ ais show storage mountpath t[TqPtghbiRw]

TqPtghbiRw
        Used Capacity (all disks): avg 15% max 18%
                                                /ais/mp1/2 /dev/nvme0n1(xfs)
                                                /ais/mp2/2 /dev/nvme1n1(xfs)
                                                /ais/mp3/2 /dev/nvme2n1(xfs)
                                                /ais/mp4/2 /dev/nvme3n1(xfs)
```

As always, `--help` will also list supported options. Note in particular the option to run continuously and periodically:

```console
$ ais show storage mountpath --help
NAME:
   ais show storage mountpath - show target mountpaths

USAGE:
   ais show storage mountpath [command options] [TARGET_ID]

OPTIONS:
   --refresh value  interval for continuous monitoring;
                    valid time units: ns, us (or Âµs), ms, s (default), m, h
   --count value    used together with '--refresh' to limit the number of generated reports (default: 0)
   --json, -j       json input/output
   --help, -h       show help
```

Show mountpaths for a given target or all targets.

> **Ease of Usage** notice: like all other `ais show` commands, `ais show storage mountpath` is an alias (or a shortcut) - in this specific case - for `ais storage mountpath show`.

### Examples (_slightly outdated_)

```console
$ ais storage mountpath show 12356t8085
247389t8085
        Available:
			/tmp/ais/5/3
			/tmp/ais/5/1
        Disabled:
			/tmp/ais/5/2

$ ais storage mountpath show
12356t8085
        Available:
			/tmp/ais/5/3
			/tmp/ais/5/1
        Disabled:
			/tmp/ais/5/2
147665t8084
        Available:
			/tmp/ais/4/3
			/tmp/ais/4/1
			/tmp/ais/4/2
426988t8086
	No mountpaths
```

## Attach mountpath

`ais storage mountpath attach TARGET_ID=MOUNTPATH [DAEMONID=MOUNTPATH...]`

Attach a mountpath on a specified target to AIS storage.

### Examples

```console
$ ais storage mountpath attach 12367t8080=/data/dir
```

## Detach mountpath

`ais storage mountpath detach TARGET_ID=MOUNTPATH [DAEMONID=MOUNTPATH...]`

Detach a mountpath on a specified target from AIS storage.

### Examples

```console
$ ais storage mountpath detach 12367t8080=/data/dir
```
