AIS command-line interface (CLI) is a tool to easily manage and monitor every aspect of the AIS clusters' lifecycle.

In addition, CLI provides dataset management commands, reading and writing primitives, and more.

Goven an existing aistore instance, maybe the very first command you execute would be `ais show cluster` - a variant of numerous `ais show` subcommands.  For example:

```console
$ ais show cluster

```

Next, montoring wise, you'd maybe run `ais show performance`, etc.

## Getting Started

To build CLI from the source, run the following two steps:

```console
$ make cli			# 1. build CLI binary and install it into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory
$ make cli-autocompletions	# 2. install CLI autocompletions (Bash or Zsh)
```

To build with debug, run:

```console
$ MODE=debug make cli
```

Alternatively, install directly from GitHub:

* [Install CLI from release binaries](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/main/scripts/install_from_binaries.sh)

For example, the following command extracts CLI binary to the specified destination and, secondly, installs `bash` autocompletions:

```console
$ ./scripts/install_from_binaries.sh --dstdir /tmp/www --completions
```

For more usage options, run: `./scripts/install_from_binaries.sh --help`

You can also install `bash` and/or `zsh` autocompletions separately at any (later) time:

* [Install CLI autocompletions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/main/cmd/cli/install_autocompletions.sh)

To uninstall autocompletions, follow the `install_autocompletions.sh` generated prompts, or simply run `bash autocomplete/uninstall.sh`.

**Please note**: using CLI with autocompletions enabled is strongly recommended.

Once installed, you should be able to start by running ais `<TAB-TAB>`, selecting one of the available (completion) options, and repeating until the command is ready to be entered.

**TL;DR**: see section [CLI reference](#cli-reference) below to quickly locate useful commands. There's also a (structured as a reference) list of CLI resources with numerous examples and usage guides that we constantly keep updating.

**TIP**: when starting with AIS, [`ais search`](/docs/cli/search.md) command may be especially handy. It will list all possible variations of a command you are maybe looking for - by exact match, synonym, or regex.

See also:

* [cmd/cli/README.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/main/cmd/cli/README.md)

> The rest of the README assumes that user's `PATH` environment variable contains `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
> Run `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin` if this is not the case.
> You can find more about $GOPATH environment [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).

## CLI Reference

The recommended and, actually, fastest way to get started with CLI is to type `ais` and press `<TAB-TAB>`:

```console
$ ais <TAB-TAB>

bucket           job              storage          remote-cluster   prefetch         evict            create
object           auth             archive          alias            put              rmo              dsort
cluster          show             log              ls               start            wait             search
config           help             tls              stop             get              blob-download
etl              advanced         performance      download         rmb              cp
```

These are the current set of top-level commands. Each command has its own extended help (the `--help` option) and, usually, multiple sub-commands
(which, in turn, have their respective inline helps and subcommands).

The list of top-level commands must give maybe the first idea of the supported functionality and functional grouping.

Following is a brief summary (that's non-exhaustive and slightly outdated):

## CLI Config

Notice:

* CLI configuration directory: `$HOME/.config/ais/cli`
* CLI configuration filename: `cli.json`

> For the most updated system filenames and configuration directories, please see [`fname/fname.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/main/cmn/fname/fname.go) source.


When used the very first time, *or* if the `$HOME/.config/ais/cli/cli.json` does not exist, the latter will be created with default parameters:

```json
$ ais config cli --json

{
    "cluster": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
        "default_ais_host": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
        "default_docker_host": "http://172.50.0.2:8080",
        "client_crt": "",
        "client_crt_key": "",
        "client_ca_tls": "",
        "skip_verify_crt": false
    },
    "timeout": {
        "tcp_timeout": "60s",
        "http_timeout": "0s"
    },
    "auth": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:52001"
    },
    "aliases": {
        "dsort": "job start dsort",
        "prefetch": "object prefetch",
        "rmo": "object rm",
        "get": "object get",
        "ls": "bucket ls",
        "wait": "job wait",
        "create": "bucket create",
        "download": "job start download",
        "start": "job start",
        "stop": "job stop",
        "blob-download": "job start blob-download",
        "cp": "bucket cp",
        "evict": "bucket evict",
        "put": "object put",
        "rmb": "bucket rm"
    },
    "default_provider": "ais",
    "no_color": false,
    "verbose": false,
    "no_more": false
}
```

CLI config can be updated using `ais config cli set` command or even simply by changing the config file.

The next time you run it CLI will use the updated values.

To get back to system defaults, run `ais config cli reset`.

## Environment variables

First and foremost, there's `AIS_ENDPOINT`. If defined, it'll take precedence over "cluster.url" (section [CLI Config](#cli-config) above).

Example:

```console
$ export AIS_ENDPOINT=https://10.07.56.68:51080
```

In addition, environment can be used to **override** client-side TLS (aka, HTTPS) configuration - the knobs "client_crt", etc. also listed in the table below:

| var name | description | the corresponding [CLI Config](#cli-config) |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `AIS_CRT`             | X.509 certificate | "cluster.client_crt" |
| `AIS_CRT_KEY`         | X.509 certificate's private key | "cluster.client_crt_key"|
| `AIS_CLIENT_CA`       | Certificate authority that authorized (signed) the certificate | "cluster.client_ca_tls" |
| `AIS_SKIP_VERIFY_CRT` | true: skip X.509 cert verification (usually enabled to circumvent limitations of self-signed certs) | "cluster.skip_verify_crt" |

## First steps

To get the list of supported commands, run:

```console
$ ais help
```

> Alternatively, you could start making use of auto-completions by typing `ais ` and pressing TAB key two times in a row.

To check if the CLI can correctly contact the cluster and to get cluster status, run following command:

```console
$ ais show cluster
```

## Global options

Besides a set of options specific for each command, AIS CLI provides global options:

- `--no-color` - by default AIS CLI displays messages with colors (e.g, errors are printed in red color).
  Colors are automatically disabled if CLI output is redirected or environment variable `TERM=dumb` is set.
  To disable colors in other cases, pass `--no-color` to the application.

Please note that the place of a global options in the command line is fixed.
Global options must follow the application name directly.
At the same time, the location of a command-specific option is arbitrary: you can put them anywhere.
Examples:

```console
$ # Correct usage of global and command-specific options.
$ ais --no-color ls ais://bck --props all
$ ais --no-color ls --props all ais://bck
$
$ # Incorrect usage of a global option.
$ ais ls ais://bck --props all --no-color
```

## Backend Provider

The syntax `provider://BUCKET_NAME` (referred to as `BUCKET` in help messages) works across all commands.
For more details, please refer to each specific command's documentation.
`provider://` can be omitted if the `default_provider` config value is set (in such case the config value will be used implicitly).

Supported backend providers currently include:
* `ais://` - AIStore provider
* `aws://` or `s3://` - Amazon Web Services
* `azure://` or `az://` - Azure Blob Storage
* `gcp://` or `gs://` - Google Cloud Storage
* `ht://` - HTTP(S) datasets

> [Buckets: definition, operations, properties](/docs/bucket.md)

## Verbose errors

CLI uses [AIS API](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/tree/main/api) to execute operations on a cluster.

Of course, a remote API call - any API call, for that matter - may return errors. For developers, it may be sometimes useful to see a complete and unredacted error information.

Here's an example where we are trying to rename a non-existing bucket:

```console
$ ais bucket mv ais://ddd ais://mmm
Error: bucket "ais://ddd" does not exist
```

But here's how it'll look once we put CLI in verbose mode:

```console
$ ais config cli set verbose true
"verbose" set to: "true" (was: "false")

$ ais bucket mv ais://ddd ais://mmm
Error: {"tcode":"ErrBckNotFound","message":"bucket \"ais://ddd\" does not exist","method":"HEAD","url_path":"/v1/buckets/ddd","remote_addr":"127.0.0.1:57026","caller":"","node":"p[JFkp8080]","status":404}: HEAD /v1/buckets/ddd (stack: [utils.go:445 <- bucket.go:104 <- bucket_hdlr.go:343])
```

## CLI Help Paging

To view help content page-by-page, CLI uses the `more` command. Disable this by setting `no_more` to `true` in your configuration.

```console
$ ais config cli set no_more=true
"no_more" set to: "true" (was: "false")
```
