## Virtual directories

Unlike hierarchical POSIX, object storage is flat, treating forward slash ('/') in object names as simply another symbol.

But that's not the entire truth. The other part of it is that user may want to operate on (ie., list, load, shuffle, copy, transform, etc.)
subset of objects in a dataset that, for the lack of better word, looks _exactly_ like a directory.

In fact, user often wants to do exactly that.
Train, for instance, on all audio files under `en_es_synthetic/v1/train/`, or similar.

> In object storages, the term for quote/unquote "what looks like a directory" is _virtual directory_ or _synthetic directory_.

The motivation may become clearer if I say that the entire real-life dataset
contains many millions of objects and numerous _virtual directories_, including the aforementioned `en_es_synthetic/v1/train/`.

Needless to say, aistore provides for all of that and more. There is a certainty subtlety, however, that makes sense to illustrate on examples.

## But first, the rules

* normally, remote backends do not return _virtual directories_, with two exceptions:
  - `list-objects` operation is non-recursive (API `apc.LsNoRecursion` in the control message, CLI `--nr` switch);
  - the bucket in question contains some sort of special directory that shows up anyway (e.g. bucket inventory).
* `list-objects` will always return _virtual directories_, assuming:
  - the corresponding backend's response includes those (see above), and
  - user does not specify `apc.LsNoDirs` (CLI `--no-dirs`)
* the output is always sorted alphanumerically, directories-first

## Examples

### 1. Show everything that has a certain prefix

```console
$ ais ls s3://speech --prefix .inventory
NAME                                                                      SIZE            CACHED
.inventory/speech/data/
.inventory/speech/2024-05-31T01-00Z/manifest.checksum                     33B             no
.inventory/speech/2024-05-31T01-00Z/manifest.json                         406B            no
.inventory/speech/data/985fc9cb-5957-4fc8-b26d-092685a747e8.csv.gz        54.14MiB        no
.inventory/speech/data/9dac8de5-cff9-432c-9663-b054ae5ce357.csv.gz        54.14MiB        no
.inventory/speech/hive/dt=2024-05-30-01-00/symlink.txt                    85B             no
.inventory/speech/hive/dt=2024-05-31-01-00/symlink.txt                    85B             no
```

### 2. Same as above using familiar `*nix` notation

```console
$ ais ls s3://speech/.inventory
```

### 3. Same as above, without directories

```console
$ ais ls s3://speech --prefix .inventory --no-dirs
NAME                                                                      SIZE            CACHED
.inventory/speech/2024-05-31T01-00Z/manifest.checksum                     33B             no
.inventory/speech/2024-05-31T01-00Z/manifest.json                         406B            no
.inventory/speech/data/985fc9cb-5957-4fc8-b26d-092685a747e8.csv.gz        54.14MiB        no
.inventory/speech/data/9dac8de5-cff9-432c-9663-b054ae5ce357.csv.gz        54.14MiB        no
.inventory/speech/hive/dt=2024-05-30-01-00/symlink.txt                    85B             no
.inventory/speech/hive/dt=2024-05-31-01-00/symlink.txt                    85B             no
```

### 4. Show dataset structure at a certain nested depth

```console
$ ais ls s3://speech --prefix .inventory/speech/ --nr
NAME                                       SIZE    CACHED
.inventory/speech/2024-05-31T01-00Z/
.inventory/speech/data/
.inventory/speech/hive/
```

### Virtual directories and data at a certain level

```console
$ ais ls s3://speech --prefix .inventory/speech/data/ --nr
NAME                                                                      SIZE            CACHED
.inventory/speech/data/
.inventory/speech/data/985fc9cb-5957-4fc8-b26d-092685a747e8.csv.gz        54.14MiB        no
.inventory/speech/data/9dac8de5-cff9-432c-9663-b054ae5ce357.csv.gz        54.14MiB        no
```
