Massively parallel loading of terabytes of data in a distributed system presents reliability challenges. This holds true even for data centers where network stability is supposed to be stellar. Consider multi-node training of a model with (hundreds of) billions of parameters — a process that takes many hours, sometimes days. A single spurious interruption of any kind may disrupt workflows, forcing one of the compute workers to fail, ultimately leading to wasted time and resources.

Introduced in [AIStore Python SDK version 1.8](https://pypi.org/project/aistore/), `ObjectFile` supports local file-like semantics and efficiently handles interrupted streams.

## Usage

`ObjectFile` is straightforward to use in the AIStore Python SDK. You can create a file-like object and read from it just as you would with any other file object:

```python
import urllib3
from aistore.sdk.client import Client

# Customize the retry behavior for the initial connection
# status_forcelist enables retries on error codes we might get from a disconnected AIS target
retry = urllib3.Retry(total=3, status_forcelist=[400, 404])
client = Client("http://localhost:8080", retry=retry)

# Get a reference to the object
obj = client.bucket(BUCKET_NAME).object(OBJECT_NAME)

# Open the object as a file and read data in chunks
with obj.get().as_file(max_resume=5) as file:
    file.read(1024) # Read the first 1KB
    file.read(1024) # Read the next 1KB 
    file.read() # Or read until EOF
```

During each `read` operation, `ObjectFile` will attempt to resume a disconnected stream up to 5 times in the above example. On each attempt to resume, the client will use the retry logic configured with the provided [urllib3.Retry](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/urllib3.util.html#urllib3.util.Retry) object.

## Background

The basic `object.get()` function in the AIS SDK returns an `ObjectReader`, which enables efficient streaming of data by providing an iterator that fetches data in chunks (using the [requests library's stream option](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#body-content-workflow)). However, it doesn’t account for network interruptions, such as unexpected stream closures that may lead to a `ChunkedEncodingError`. In the case of a failure, the entire stream may need to be manually restarted, resulting in major inefficiencies and redundant data transfer.

`ObjectFile` addresses this problem by wrapping `ObjectReader` with a file-like interface that incorporates buffer management and logic to handle unexpected interruptions to the object stream. By resuming streams from the exact byte where an interruption occurred, `ObjectFile` eliminates the need to re-fetch previously read data, ensuring uninterrupted data access even in unstable network conditions.

## How <code style="font-size: 92%;">ObjectFile</code> Works

`ObjectFile` extends `io.BufferedIOBase`, offering a familiar file-like interface for reading streamed objects in chunks and handling interruptions gracefully. It relies on `ObjectReader` to fetch object data in chunks and maintains an internal buffer to optimize reads.

When a `read` operation is initiated, `ObjectFile` first checks if the requested data is already in the buffer. If sufficient data is available, it reads directly from the buffer. If not, it fetches additional chunks from the object stream using the iterator and refills the buffer.

If a network interruption occurs and the iterator raises a `ChunkedEncodingError`, `ObjectFile` automatically attempts to re-establish the connection to the object in AIS. It does this by issuing an [HTTP range request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) starting at the next byte that hasn’t yet been loaded into the buffer. This ensures that no previously accessed data is fetched again, and the stream resumes seamlessly from where it left off.

Once the buffer has sufficient data, `ObjectFile` reads directly from it to complete the `read` operation.

## Integrating <code style="font-size: 92%;">ObjectFile</code> in File-like Contexts

Because `ObjectFile` extends `io.BufferedIOBase`, you can use it in any context where a non-seekable file-like object is expected. For instance, `ObjectFile` works seamlessly with libraries like `tarfile` (in [streaming modes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.open) such as `r|*`, `r|`, `r|gz`, where the pipe `|` indicates sequential streaming of tar blocks) and `csv`, which rely on standard file objects for sequential reads:

```python
# Stream and extract a tar file
with client.bucket(BUCKET_NAME).object(OBJECT_NAME).get().as_file(max_resume=5) as file_obj:
    with tarfile.open(fileobj=file_obj, mode='r|*') as tar:
        for member in tar:
            print(f"Extracting {member.name}")
            tar.extract(member)

# Stream a CSV file and iterate through rows
with client.bucket(BUCKET_NAME).object(OBJECT_NAME).get().as_file(max_resume=5) as obj_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(obj_file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
```

In both cases, the `file_obj` ensures that streaming continues smoothly, even in the event of interruptions. The `max_resume` parameter dictates how many times each `read` operation (called internally by libraries like `csv`, `tarfile`, or similar) is allowed to resume following an interruption.

## Future Work

While `ObjectFile` brings substantial improvements in terms of resilience and performance in streaming environments, there are several avenues for further optimization and enhancements:

#### Custom Buffer Size

In the initial implementation, `ObjectFile` uses an internal buffer of the same size requested by the reader (on each call to `read()`). For reading larger chunk sizes over the network, we rely on the `object.get()` `chunk_size` parameter, which can exceed the requested buffer size. With a larger chunk size, the buffer will often still hold enough data for multiple reads. 

Adding support for custom buffer sizes would allow further performance optimization by separating the buffer size from the amount specified in each `read` call. More work still needs to be done to determine optimal sizes for read, buffer, and chunk iteration (see [Benchmarking](#benchmarking) section below for ongoing efforts to fine-tune these sizes).

#### Read-Ahead Buffer with Parallelization

Implementing a read-ahead buffer that pre-fetches data in parallel would minimize latency between reads. This approach would better utilize network bandwidth and avoid blocking during larger data fetches.

#### Benchmarking

Further benchmarks are currently underway to:

- Ensure minimal performance degradation under normal conditions.
- Demonstrate faster recovery from interruptions using range requests.
- Fine-tune buffer and chunk sizes for optimal stability and performance.

These results, which will also help guide the tuning of custom buffer sizes, will be detailed in an upcoming follow-up blog.

## Conclusion

Addressing intermittent spurious interruptions is critical for resilient data streaming, and `ObjectFile` is our specific approach to solving this issue. As mentioned above, further evaluation is needed to confirm its effectiveness in minimizing overhead and improving performance.

Easy integration with existing workflows and familiar file-like behavior makes `ObjectFile` a practical choice for managing stream interruptions without requiring major changes to existing workflows.
